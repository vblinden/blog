title: Never. Forget. Backups.

Unfortunately DigitalOcean had a node failure yesterday in their AMS3
data center. And sadly my virtual machine running my blog was on there
and I didn't have backups enabled. So all my data is permanently gone.
Which is not a huge problem, because I only had two small blog posts
on here. So today I decided to make my blog again with the amazing
<a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>
 and host it on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.
